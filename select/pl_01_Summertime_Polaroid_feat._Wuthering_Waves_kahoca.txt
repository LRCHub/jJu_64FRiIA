I see the twilight burning
Colors on the rolling tide
(Shining)
Feels like I’m on cloud nine
Got me feeling so free
Taking flight beyond the sky-y
Let your hair down, feel the wind (dancing)
Can you hear them calling out? (of summer)
The stars are guiding the beat
Come and catch all the stars as they’re falling
You and me — diving into the new world
Tell me
All you wanna do in the summertime
Hearts are beating loud
With you right by my side
We keep on dancing to the waves of time
Don’t wanna miss this
Can’t let this feeling
So magical
Oh ah ah
Oh ah ah
Ice in my glass, singing
Floating on the time we share
(Glowing)
Under the golden light
Wish we could just stay here
Right in this moment
Forever
Let your hair down, feel the wind (dancing)
Can you hear them calling out? (of summer)
The stars are guiding the beat
Come and catch all the stars as they’re falling
You and me — diving into the new world
Tell me
What do you wanna feel in the summertime
Hearts are beating loud
With you right by my side
Cruising around the city, feel the beat
Endless summer
That’s how we feel it
It’s all here
I dreamed of something like this
The kind of day I saw in my head
Feet off the ground — it’s simple
Time flies, so catch the feeling
You and me — diving into the new world
Tell me
All you wanna do in the summertime
Hearts are beating loud
With you right by my side
We keep on dancing to the waves of time
Don’t wanna miss this
Can’t let this feeling
So magical
