I see that twilight burning, colors on the rolling tide
Shining, feels like I'm on cloud nine
Got me feeling so free, taking flight beyond the sky
Reach out and feel the wind, dancing
Can you hear them calling out of summer?
The stars are guiding the beat
Gonna catch all the stars as they're falling
You and me dive into the new world
Tell me, how you wanna do in the summertime?
Hearts are beating now with you right by my side
We keep on dancing to the waves of time
Don't wanna miss this
Can't let this feeling, so magical
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
La-la-la-la-la, la-la
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I see my glass singing, floating on the time we share
Glowing under the golden light
Wish we could just stay here right in this moment forever
Reach out and feel the wind, dancing
Can you hear them calling out of summer?
The stars are guiding the beat
Gonna catch all the stars as they're falling
You and me dive into the new world
Tell me, what do you wanna feel in the summertime?
Hearts are beating now with you right by my side
Cruising around this city, feel the beat
Endless summer, that's how we feel it
It's all here
I dreamed of something like this
The kind of day I saw in my head
Feet off the ground, it's simple
Time flies to catch the feelings
You and me dive into the new world
Tell me, how you wanna do in the summertime?
Hearts are beating now with you right by my side
We keep on dancing to the waves of time
Don't wanna miss this
Can't let this feeling, so magical
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
La-la-la-la-la, la-la
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
